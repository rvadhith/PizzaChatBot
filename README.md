# PizzaChatBot

In this application I have built a chatbot which can take pizza orders. It can track the order as well.

The application has been built using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Ordering Pizza:

Step 1: Press the Make order button
Step 2: Choose either Veg Pizza or Non Veg Pizza by pressing the relevant button
Step 3: Choose the size (Small, Medium, Large) by pressing the relevant button
Step 4: Choose the quantity by entering the value in the text box and press enter
Step 5: Choose whether to add more pizza to the order list by pressing the yes or no button. I you want to add more pizza, please repeat steps 2-4
Step 6: Please enter your name in the text box and press enter
Step 7: Please enter your phone number in the text box and press enter
Step 8: Please enter your address in the text box and press enter

Finally a thank you text with the total cost of the order will be displayed.

Tracking Order:

Step 1: Press the Track order button
Step 2: If the entered id is valid, appropriate order status will be displayed on screen. If not "Sorry the entered id doesn't exist" text will be displayed
